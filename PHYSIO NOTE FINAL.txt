*list some injuries or tissue problems that you think might be influencing your pain:
-back left side above the upper glute always pain from here
-back left side aove the upper glute cracking when pressed and painful and falling on that side whe nwalking 
-dont know if there anythign else not that i think the upper glute is the probelm 
 but its one thing i found consistnly when i get the back pain and left leg burning



*what i think i can do:
-taking care of stress by doing stuff i like 
-moving more since i sit alot becuase of my job 
-work on increasing strength 
-wok on increase flexibility mobility




*Is this something that needs rest or is it something that you need to “stress” to make it adapt or desensitize?
-definitly stress to desecentize. the resting state is painful


*Is it something that might exist but might not be the entire reason for your pain? Are there other things that might be sensitizing you?
-i dont know. i listed the things i thought caused it above
  




List some of the movements that aggravate your pain
-when walking and my left leg hits somthing as i walk or get caught on the floor so i havent raised my leg high enough and when it contacts
 the surfaces i get an extreme jolt to the lower back extremly painful 
-tilting forwar with when sitting or standing while back straight
-arching back to relif upper back and left neck and shoulder pain which relieves that pain there but causes my lower back pain
-normal bending to get something because immobile lower back i have to press to bend to get somethign and i get a jolt of pain 
-slouchign while seated on the floor not immediate but aafter like 20 or 30 secodns i ge a jolt of pain 
-in bed i get shivers in my absthat press my abs in and arches back which causes pain in lower back
-while laying in bed if i push some thing with my leg left or right it sometimes causes pain 
-having something pressed on my lower back while sitting	
-if i am slouched sitting i get pain in my lower back




*Do you think that you continue to do these things perhaps without realizing it?
-some of these things arent done often but when they do they cauase pain and i am not aware that that 
 particual movement would cuase pain its just when it happens the pain comes out 
-others i do willfully like the arching of the back to relief my neck and shoulder 
 pain which does relief my back hwoever it will then cuase pain in lower back


*Do you think that you might do these things because you have been told you should?
-no majority of them happen by chance 
-but the main triggers like the arching of the back no one told me but i need to do it to releif my neck and shoulder and upper back pain



*do you think you have any phsical impariments that really need addressing to help you desensitize?
-not particularly 
-bending lower back gives me some relief but its tight and causes pain
-my upper back neck and shoulder arching to relief them is caussing lower back pain so if 
 were to not have to arch as much would less likely to sensitize my lower back 



*What are some of the things you did before you had pain that you no longer do and wish you could do?
-most of the things i liked before pain i still do with the pain however most of them include sitting however they have been significantly reduced 
-what i want to do is the normal stuff that i used to do that i cannot do 
-going out with friends they might go out for more than 2 to 3 hours i cannot keep up with them or if we bought stuff i cannot 
 carrying stuff from the groccery or stores 
-sleeping and on weekends laying in bed when i wake up, i no longer can do that 
-walking normally when i walk for more than 15 to 20 minutes my back starts to round when i go to see things i slowch and cannot 
 look up to see stuff if im visiting new places to explore 
-sitting(although a bit better now)
-going to work in a coffeee shop i cannot sit  becuase of the pain that comes if sit more than 30 minutes
-watching movies and tvshows 
-playing video games
-playing card games with friends
HOWEVER there is nothing that i enjoy that i have stopped it just that they have een reduced 




*Do you find that you are avoiding a lot of the activities that you once enjoyed?
-well sometimes i still do them but i cannot do them normally like i used to 


*do you find that avoiding someof the activities ythat you once enjoyed mighte  be a factor for your pain for your overall
 health or just for your enjoyment in life?
-i think afte rreading this book and talking to physio i do realize that some of pain can come from other areas
 however i think in this case its not avoiding but the stress that i cannot do it as i used to or i am afraid i will get the pain 
 if i do it so that will contribute to the pain 



*how is our sleep?how much ?quality?is your pain worse when you sleep is poor
-my sleep was really really bad i would wake up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night 
 but i cannot go back to sleep becuase the pain is excrutiation to lay down however 
 recently it has gotten a bit better i can go back to sleop if i wake up like 3 to 4 hours in,
 but i still get pain when i wake up after 7 hours but i am getting up to 6 to 7 hours most of the time 
 due to strengthing the specific muscles where i have the pain although physios keep telling me its not related .
 In terms of my pain is it worse or better when i sleep its gonnna be a strange answer becuase when i lay down to sleep 
 there is no pain from laying down however i do have the pain however when i wake up the pain is gone however
 my msucles are extremly sore that i cannot sta layed down again i was thinking becuase something is happening during sleep 
 like pressure on msucles becuae there to weak or something 


*do you go to sleep and wake at the same time?
-im not sure i understand the question if you mean if im gonna fall asleep then jolt up again 
 then the answer is no 

*do you drink caffeine in the eveneing 
-i dont drink caffeine



*Do you exercise or watch bright screens (phones) just before going to bed?
-i dont exercsise and i try to minimize screen time 



*have you had a large change in any form of stress in your life(work social faimily emotional)if so what happend?
-i think the major things that happend was during covid where i was forced to take 
 the vaccine and during that same night i started having heart issues i woke up shivering really really hard as well as feeling extremly cold and i coudlnt breath
 becuase if i breath that would really put pressure on my heart 
 i struggled to get the phone and called hospital they told me to monitor my heart rate it was 23/18 
 they told me to take 2 panadol pills which then  my symptoms slowly started to go away over the span of the entire night 
 which i couldnt go back to sleep i started sweating alot as well the extreme cold turned to extreme hot 
 the er couldnt come during the time that was probably 3 years ago and then after that 
 i started getting coughs and sore throat alot each time i go to doctor they would give me antibiotics and reflux medication
 so i was really really stressed about those events and one doctor told me its due to reflux so i took extrem measures 
 like sleeping half sitting up as well as not eating to loose weight and i lost alot of weight realyl fast and the symptoms did go away
 but now i had my then main stresser in my life which was worse than the reflux 
 which is my lower back pain and then neck pain which were not well the typical
 and its not the typical pain that well achcing pain that i get in back those were like major epsidoes where
 i woke up at night and my left leg is on fire i would toss and term i would get up it was extreme 
 there was also another for the neck where i woke up and soemthign cracked and i can no longer get up my left shoudler got so swollon 
 i had to call my family to come lift me up so those were like major major stressors in my life 
 i do fear i think this is one stressful thing which is i fear that i will one day wake up and have that occur to me 
 although i have a bit gained confidence well at least for my neck i have trained it a bit that even though i wake up with sore 
 neck i feel like the msucles there would protect against any wrong movement 
 so those were the major stressors of my life generally its the pain iteslf but in terms
 of like external stuff no 

*Do you have any secondary medical diagnoses? Are you being helped with those?
-i did an endocosopy for my reflux and they are not sure if its reflux caused or its a case called eoe 
 however they gave me medication which im taking and im waiting for my rescope however it is improving 


*do you find that you avoid doing painful movements?
-i think i do well for some of them so some that i dont really need to do like
 running or jumping im afraid of doing those thigns i feel there really will be causing pain 
 or aggrevating my situation and well i dont usually do those things the other things like 
 bending over or picking stuff up the floor or carrying heavy stuff and what hapepnd 
 well after reading this book i would gain confidence in bending forward or picking up heavy stuff
 i would get a jolt of intense pain in my back which then remvoes that confidence to do it 
 and then i would say well its just one time thing and then the jolt would come back and symptoms becomes worse
 so i loose confidence


*are you worried about harming yourself?
-well i just dont want to cause more problems and make things worse so i guess yes


*Do you feel that pain is telling you that there is tissue damage and you must stop?
-i mean i used to think that that i got pain that means there is something wrong not specifically tissue damage
 hwoever since taking to physio they say no everything is fine so i dont know anymore
 so i start doing the movements again anywas up untill it starts causing pain so i stop doing it 


*Do you keep pushing into pain?
-no


*Do you think that pain should always be ignored and that if you try hard enough the pain will go away?
-well i dont think pain should be ignored i guess it depends on the situation if someone suffered an injury
 then that pain needs attention however if somenoe has pain that is not related to injury then i trying to ignore 
 the pain simply by offering something good well im not sure that would work i think it can help but i think a better management 
 strategy then just ignoring the pain i thin an assurance plan paired with doing stuff they like is good strategy 
 assruance strategy is checkups with pyhsio to esnure nothing is wrong as well as stregnthingin muscles and improving flexibility 
 its hard for someoen to ignore pain and believe its not due to issues when they are absoltly weak and cannot move now that doesnt mean its not 
 false but in terms of havin the faith and the trust that i can ignore it


*Do you suffer from anxiety or depression?
-no

*If so, is it well managed? If not, Do you think you need help dealing with this?
-none


*Does fear of movement dominate your thoughts or influence what you do?
-not currently it used to be yea a bit high fearing that if i move in a wrong way or if i do not keep my spine straight i will get pain
 however now i am more willing to put my self into different positions bend over to pick up something however when i do those things like
 bending down to pick something and pick up something and i get a jolt o pain in my back i re develop fear and become anxious to bend over again 
 this persists for a couple of days untill i start to like try it again and then regain my confidence 
 however i would avoid stuff that are intense like if there is omsethign ehavy on the floor i would avoid bending and carry it since im not sure 
 what my capacity is and what load i can handle since if simple body weight bending would cause pain  
 


*Do you think you will harm yourself when you do movements?
-i dont anymore however when i do the movement and it causes pain 
 i do get anxious to redo the movement thinking it will cause harm 
 then after a couple of days i would retest it and do the mvoment again 
 but well maybe yes if i get the pain when i do the movment like a sharp dagger pain 
 i do afraid if i do it again that it is worsening 



*Do you think pain means there is a lot of damage and you must stop?
-well im not sure anymore i dont think so but if the pain happens 
 i would stop doing the thing what caused the pain temporarily 





*How likely do you feel you are to be able to recover and have a lot less pain?
-alot i really do have high hopes and i feel like i would do someting and it would cause 
 my pain to go away or if i watch a video or do my own reserach then i would do something and improvment it 
 vs when i went to a physio and they would just tell me im fine there is nothing wrong with you as im in pain 
 which is somewhat infurirating and then i would go and do the exercises i would look upa nd that would solve some of the issues
 although i dont have the data the verified resach and the stattsics to really know how to tackle my situation that well why i go to physio
 but physio really think my case is a joke and my really biggest fear is that my case gets worse thats really my 
 fear is that my case is getting worse and worse and i can prevent it but i dont know how and when i seek help they dont want to help 
 like the kyphosis i didnt have it my pictures from 3 years ago it wasnt there even when i came first time to pyhsio i dint ahve the issues
 but then i start to feel it through seeing it through how my cloth fit through my friend and family telling me what happend 
 i go to physio they tell me there is nothing then i do nothing it gets worse i now when i lay down i feel ther is a turtle shell on my back 
 and in terms of how it looks its really worse now then i read online and well they say its postural kyphosus do to well you sit alot or getting 
 into that slouched position and well i ask if it can be well fixed and they say if its postural then you can make it better however id ont know how 
 then i go to physio and well first of all they dont believe that its new even though im 
 telling them and they say how do you know its postural and you werent born with it 
 and they tell me its normal everyone is diffenet and i should just accept it and you know thats my fear 
 its the progressino and the people who try to help me keep telling me its ok its ok as i watch it get worse and worse

(this is a stresful sitatuion actually i didnt realize as i am writing this part i didnt realize i had this anger and frutration :P
